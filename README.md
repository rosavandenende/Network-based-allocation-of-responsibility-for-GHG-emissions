## Empirical applications of the model as described in Network-based allocation of responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, by R. van den Ende, A. Mandel, A. Rusinowska.

## Data
The data used can be downloaded from https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/valuechain/wiod/wiod-2016-release. We also included the csv files that are derived from this data (in the folder src/data)

## Outline
- The folder src/matrix_utils contains all functions to get convert the xlsx data in csv, to normalize acccordingly (upstream/downstream) and to save as .npy files.
- The folder src/functions_utils contains all functions to calculate the responsibility for given discount factors and upstream/downstream parameters. Both for on the national and the sectoral level.
- The folder src/plots contains the code that has been used to generate the figures that are in the paper.
